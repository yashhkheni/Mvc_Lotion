after creating the project tried to run it and then facing one error because i was not installing the certificate of HTTPS and the browser was not letting me to access the project.

3:10PM
okay, now after making it sure that project is running smooth.
Changed my company name to my project called 'Forest Face Care' from _Layout.cshtml

3:11PM
Now turning my van towards the controller...
going to add controller let's see..
added new controller called LotionsController.cs following the tutorial.

3:24PM
Pushed my readme file to the repository.
Added using System.Text.Encodings.Web; to my controller copy pasted from the tutorial.

10:00PM
STARTED FROM WHERE I PAUSED but started new because i was not able to my project from my laptop which i created in lab
but no worries i knew what to do.

started fresh at 10.00PM CREATED MY new PROJECT and named as the same but this time i have created new repository called Mvc_Lotion. and linked it with my visual studio.

after successfuly creating it i have thought about my properties of the product which is lotion.....


12:15AM
IT IS NIGHT, and I think i am gonna take all night to finishing up this project. Okay Now i have google searched about my product and there were many properties that i have found among which i have selected 6 of them.


12:20AM
Created Lotion.cs AND
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
and AFTER that file i have added all my properties to that model and as i was told not to add data through table but only through seeding the data so i am going to seed the data manual by creating SeedData.cs file and will add all my raw data to that file and system should display all those data to lotion page.

and then after i have scaffhold the pages.

01:15AM

MIDRATED THE DATABASE using this command
Add-Migration InitialCreate
Update-Database

hopefully this should work.
